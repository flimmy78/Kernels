This example of user space agent connectiong to error interrupts handler and getting netlink messages about DRAM ECC errors.

To see the message, compile the agent "cc netlink-user.c -o netlink-user" and run it on kernel compiled with ERROR_HANDLING_DRAM_ECC enabled.
After cause DRAM ECC error and check dmesg.

General flow of the agent:
1. Establish netink to kernel agent.
2. Wait for messages from armadaxp_error_event in kernel.
3. Get the message, cast it to appropriate structure and analize the data sent from kernel.
